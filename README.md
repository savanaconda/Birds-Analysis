# Birds-Model

Creating a model to predict species survival with data from Cornell's eBird database

Accessed csv file of eBird Observation Dataset from Cornell Lab of Ornithology
on Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) website:
https://www.gbif.org/dataset/4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e

Shortened data to more manageable chunk with **GetShortCSV.py**

Created a csv file **model_birddata.csv** with relevant data from original file and some feature
engineered parameters (X,Y,Z coordinates and Absolute Date)

Plotted maps of sighting and further analysis to come in **birds_model.py**
